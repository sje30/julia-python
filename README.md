# Julia and Python environments

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/julia_python/master)

This example shows how you can install a Julia and Python environment side-by-side.
In this repository are *both* an `environment.yml` file as well as a `REQURE` file.
The former corresponds to an anaconda python environment, and the latter corresponds
to a Julia environment. Both kernels will be available to you in a built Binder
environment.
