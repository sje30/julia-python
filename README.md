# Julia and Python environments


[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sje30/julia-python/master?filepath=Introduction%20to%20Computational%20Neuroscience.ipynb)

This example shows how you can install a Julia and Python environment side-by-side.
In this repository are *both* an `environment.yml` file as well as a `REQURE` file.
The former corresponds to an anaconda python environment, and the latter corresponds
to a Julia environment. Both kernels will be available to you in a built Binder
environment.
